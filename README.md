# Artist-s-Statment-
 I am a self taught painter.  My father painted, and I was introduced to paint and canvas at a young age.   I am influenced by  the impressionists of paintingâ€™s past.  The works of Vincent an Gogh stand out in my mind as I see brush stokes.  Paul Klee reminds me of color.  My recent painting titled Window Rock Is an experiment in style and materials.  Future experiments will follow. 
I am Flynn.
